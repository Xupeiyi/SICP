suppose we have interval 1, whose center is c1 and percent is p1, and interval 2, whose center is c2 and percent is p2.  
for interval 1 * interval 2, the upper bound is c1(1 + p1) * c2(1 + p2) = c1 * c2 * (1 + p1 + p2 + p1 * p2), which is almost equal to c1 * c2 * (1 + p1 + p2)  
likewise, the lower bound is c1 * c2 (1 - p1 - p2)  
therefore, the interval has center c1 * c2 and percent p1 + p2.
